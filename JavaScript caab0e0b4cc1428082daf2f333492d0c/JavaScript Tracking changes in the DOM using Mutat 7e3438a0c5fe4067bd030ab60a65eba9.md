**Web apps** are getting heavy on the client-side: richer UI to accomodate, real-time calcuations.

## `MutationObserver`

Mutation Observer is a Web API provided by modern browsers for detecting changes in the DOM.

- This allows to listen to newly added or removed nodes, attribute changes or changes in the text content of text nodes.

**Use Cases**

- Notify users that some change has occured on the page he's on.
- Working on a new framework that loads dynamically JavaScript modules based on how the DOM changes.
- Detect changes so you can easily undo/redo on a WYSIWYG editor

- Covers every single change that can possibly occur in the DOM.
- Way more optimized as it fires the changes in batches.
- Supported by all major modern browsers

### Alternatives

- **Polling**

    Simplest and most unsophisticated way.

    Using the browser's setInterval WebAPI, you can periodically check if any changes have occurred.

    This degrades web app/website performance.

- **MutationEvents**

    Mutation events are fired on every single change in the DOM â†’ Performoance Issues ðŸ”¥

- **CSS animations**

    Create an animation which would be triggered once an element has been added to the DOM.

    When animatinon starts: `animationstart` event will be fired.

    if you attached an event handler, you know when the element has been added to the DOM.
